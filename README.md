Welcome to the Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction project, supported and guided by the YBI Foundation. In this project, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 98% using a Random Forest Classifier model to recognize hand-written digits.

## About the Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recognize hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. We used Google Colab for its collaborative and cloud-based computing capabilities, making it accessible to anyone interested in experimenting with machine learning.

## Model Details

- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier

- **Accuracy:** 98%

The Random Forest Classifier is known for its versatility and excellent performance in classification tasks, which made it a suitable choice for this project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Open in Google Colab:**
   - Upload the project to your Google Drive.
   - Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab for hands-on experience.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the model.
   - Explore the code, parameters, and results.

## Dataset

The hand-written digit dataset used in this project was generously provided by YBI Foundation through Kaggle resources. It is a widely recognized dataset for training and testing machine learning models.

## Credits

- **YBI Foundation:** We would like to extend our gratitude to YBI Foundation for providing the high-quality hand-written digit dataset and their guidance in this project.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the open-source community for their valuable contributions to the tools and libraries used in this project. Without their efforts, this project would not have been possible.

Happy coding and digit recognition!
